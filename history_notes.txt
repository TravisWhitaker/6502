Beginning at Motorola

-Most of the engineers that designed the mos 6502 originated from the team 
 that developed the Motorola 6800 series

-6800 engineers
    [
    -John Buchanan - 6800 chip designer
    -Rod Orgill - Circuit analysis and chip layout (later worked on the 6501) 
    ] (source 3) 

    -Bill Mensch - Designe peripheral IC's for the 6800 family. Later would
                   design the Periferal Interface Adapter for the 6820
    -Chuck Peddle - Architectural Support of the 6800.(wiki 13)  Designed the 6850 ACIA serial interface
                    (architect support work of the 6502) (wiki 14)

-Motorola target customers were large computing and electronics firms.
    -main focus was to reduce development cost for these firms as opposed to 
     reducing the cost of their processors.  Doing so by providing prototype 
     processors and providing development software through timesharing.  
-Target Firms
    -HP
    -Textronix
    -TRW
    -Chrysler

-Chuck Peddle saw how clients disliked the high price of the 6800 ($300) when 
 accompanying sales representatives on customer visits. To remedy this Peddle and
 other 6800 engineers who saw the issue began outlining a more cost effective design.  (source 1)
 One that would remove inessential debugging features and utilize depletion-mode MOS 
 transistors.  Doing so would reduce size to produce more chips on a silicon wafer and 
 thus effectively reduce the cost to around $25.  (source 2)

-Due to Motorola's new fabrication plant in Austin Texas having difficulty with 
 utilizing depletion-mode technology in fabrication and Motorola not liking the idea of designing 
 cheaper processors Chuck Peddle's idea for making a more cost effective 6800 was dismissed.  
 Peddle saw this as "product abandonment" so he decided to no longer work on the 6800 and 
 move forward with his more effective design.  (source 1)

Move to MOS Technology

-To continue his more ideal design for the 6800 Chuck Peddle teamed up with his old colleague John Pavinen 
 from General Electric who was running a fabrication company by the name of MOS Technologies.  Bringing on
 Bill Mensch and several other key Motorola engineers to this project they began work on Peddle's CPU .  
 With MOS Technology they were able to better fabricate their designs with the use of depletion-mode MOS 
 transistors.  Another key benefit of working with MOS Technologies was their improved fabrications process
 that significantly reduced the production of defective chips.  Most fabrication methods in the 1970's 
 had a 30% success rate when producing chips.  MOS however developed a method in which a correction stage was 
 added to the chip manufacturing process. It would attempt to remove errors before reaching the final 
 fabrication stage which made the chip production success rate come to 70% effectively reducing waste cost.  
 To further improve cost effectiveness Peddle instructed his team to implement processor instructions that 
 most customers required for their products.  Removing some of the more bloated debugging concepts that the 
 Motorola 6800 had which in tandem with the use of depletion-mode technology significantly decreased the size
 and ultimately cost of the processors. (source 1)  The end products being the MOS 6501 and 6502.   

Motorola Lawsuit
-When their products were introduced to Wescon it became a massive hit.  Their low cost processor
 received extensive press coverage which beneficial also had a downside.  Motorola was able to see the 
 popularity of their former engineers work making them now a serious competitor.  At first they tried 
 reducing the costs of their processors and design kits.  Their cost reduction didn't quite meet the cost of 
 the MOS 6501 and 6502 so they they pursued an injunction in Federal Court to prevent MOS Technology from 
 manufacturing and selling the chips.  

-Motorola was able to push this through as they were a wealthy company with a believable case of infringement 
 since many of their key engineers who designed the Motorola 6800 were also apart of the MOS 6502 and 6501 design
 team.  Chuck Peddle, Bill Mensch, and a few other engineers were named as inventors in their patents for the
 6800.  Along with this one of the engineers, Mike James, brought into project by Peddle took in his 6800
 designs.(wiki 44)  Which Peddle had said not to do when they began work on the MOS 6501 and 6502.  Since MOS 
 Technology was still small and lacked the money to fight this case they instead settled and agreed to 4
 things.  MOS Technology would return the 6800 documents taken, pay Motorola $200,000,  remove the 6501 from
 their product line,  and agree to cross-license processor patents. (wiki 45)  This didn't affect the rise 
 of the MOS Technology in the use of personal computers fortunately because the 6502 was their flagship processor 
 while the 6501 was more of a demonstration model for their technology. (source 1)

Beginnings of the Microcomputer
- With the legality troubles over MOS Technology began working on development kits to get their products out
  to companies.  Chuck Peddle designed the MDT-650 (Microcomputer Development Terminal) which was a single 
  board development computer with terminal. Another development board made that was sold partially completed 
  was the KIM-1 (Keyboard Input Monitor) which was very popular amongst hobbyists as well as engineers.

- With the popularity of the MOS 6502 building it saw its first popular use by Apple Computers in the creation
  of the Apple I developed by Steve Wozniak. The Apple II would also come to use the MOS 6502 but the biggest 
  and most popular customer for the time to use the chip was Commodore in just about everyone of its products.  
  Ranging from the Commodore PET, VIC-20, and the popular Commodore 64.  Even their floppy disk drive utilized 
  a 6502 to function. This popular use lead to Commodore acquiring MOS Technology for developing their chips 
  and giving them quicker access to newer chips.   Aside from the popularity of the processor in the personal 
  computer market video games companies saw it as usable for creating processor based video games.  

Gaming in the U.S. and the Japanese Market
- The Founders of Atari, Ted Dabney and Nolan Bushnell, in 1970's began to investigate microprocessor based 
  video games as opposed to using discrete logic like for their arcade games.  This would provide the ability 
  to write games in software so a home entertainment system could play multiple different games.  Their 
  prototype processor based console, titled Stella, utilized a lower cost version of the MOS 6502 called the 
  6507.  The 6507 was basically a modified 6502 but cheaper to make for being a more ideal for its use in deisgning 
  thei  prototype.  This prototype Would com to be known as the Atari 2600.  

- Outside Atari the arcade market in japan caught hold of the chip and began utilizing a different variation of 
  the 6502 made by Rioch.  This variation removed binary-coded decimal and added 22 memory-mapped Registers for
  sound, joystick reading, and sprite list DMA.  This modifed version of the 6502 was cost-effective and had more
  features useful for video games.  However due to the obscurity of the 6502 in the Japanese market Nintendo had
  to develop its own proprietary software development platform for making games.  The creation of which brought 
  about the model for unified platform development as well as software liscensing that is still used today.
